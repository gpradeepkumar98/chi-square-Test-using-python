# Chi-Square Test

The chi-square test is a statistical method used to determine the association between categorical variables. It is commonly used in various fields for analyzing contingency tables and assessing the independence or dependence of variables.

## Types of Chi-Square Tests

There are two main types of chi-square tests:

1. **Chi-Square Test for Independence (Contingency Table Test):** This test is used to check if there is a significant association between two categorical variables.

    - **Chi-Square Statistic (χ²):** Measures the discrepancy between observed and expected frequencies.
    
    - **Degrees of Freedom:** Calculated as (r - 1) * (c - 1), where "r" is the number of rows and "c" is the number of columns in the table.

    - **P-value:** A small p-value (< 0.05) indicates a significant association.

2. **Chi-Square Goodness of Fit Test:** This test checks if observed data fits an expected distribution.

    - **Chi-Square Statistic (χ²):** Quantifies how well the observed data fits the expected distribution.
    
    - **Degrees of Freedom:** Depend on the number of categories and parameters in the expected distribution.

    - **P-value:** A small p-value indicates a significant difference between observed and expected frequencies.

## How to Perform a Chi-Square Test

To perform a chi-square test, follow these steps:

1. Formulate your null hypothesis (H0) and alternative hypothesis (H1).
2. Collect and organize your data into a contingency table (for the independence test) or determine expected frequencies (for the goodness of fit test).
3. Calculate the chi-square statistic.
4. Determine the degrees of freedom.
5. Look up the critical chi-square value from a chi-square distribution table or use a statistical calculator to find the p-value.
6. Compare the calculated chi-square statistic to the critical value or p-value to make a decision regarding the null hypothesis.
7. Interpret the results and draw conclusions about the association or goodness of fit.

Chi-square tests are valuable tools for analyzing categorical data and identifying patterns or dependencies between variables. They are widely used in hypothesis testing, quality control, and research across various fields.
